# Build a Backend REST API with Python, Django, and Docker

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the course "Build a Backend REST API using Python, Django (3.2), Django REST Framework (3.12), Docker, GitHub Actions, Postgres and Test Driven Development!"

## About the Course

In this advanced course, I learned how to build a robust Backend REST API using Python and the latest technologies. From user authentication to creating and updating user profiles, filtering and searching objects, and even handling image uploads, I acquired the essential skills to create a successful app.

The highlight of this course was the practical project, a recipe API. I constructed an advanced recipe API that allows me to store and manage my favorite recipes. With features like creating recipes, setting prices, cooking times, ingredients, and tags, it's like having a virtual recipe box!

## What I Learned

Throughout the course, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, including:

- Setting up a local development server using Docker and Docker-Compose.
- Embracing Test Driven Development (TDD) to write clean and robust Python code.
- Crafting a powerful REST API capable of advanced functions like image uploads and viewing.
- Creating a reliable backend that serves as a foundation for future projects or MVPs.
- Applying best practice principles such as adhering to PEP-8 coding standards.
- Automating code checks using GitHub Actions.
